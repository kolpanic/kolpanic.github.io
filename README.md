I'm a Toronto-based developer spending most of my time in Xcode. I used to work at [Flixel](https://flixel.com/kolpanic), where our app Cinemagraph Pro for macOS won a [2014 Apple Design Award](https://youtu.be/SGiYm__R0v8?t=2261).

I'm also a co-founder—and co-runner for its first ten years—of [tacow / Toronto CocoaHeads](https://www.meetup.com/tacow-org/).

I have a number open-source projects available [here on Github](https://github.com/kolpanic), including [ZipKit](https://github.com/kolpanic/ZipKit), an Objective–C framework for using PKZip archives on macOS and iOS.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kolpanic) or email at kmoskowski _at_ me _dot_ com.
